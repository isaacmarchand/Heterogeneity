# Heterogeneity
Code used for research about heterogeneity in pension pool

## functionsYoS.R
Contain the functions used to estimate the number of years of stability with simulations and a quick example

## functionSimulatedPVDist.R
Contain the function used to simulate an emperical distribution of the PV of the benefits. It has a function for homogeneous pool and one for heterogeneous pool with 2 subgroup. It also contains example code to plot unconditional distribution, ditribution conditional on the age of death and to plot the the mean and sd of the present value per age.

## functionAsymptoticPVDist.R
Contain a function that compute the variance of the asymptotic distribution of the PV of the benefits for an homogeneous pool.
